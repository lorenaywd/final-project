CleanThis project ( cleaning service application)
This is the final project I had to complete in a group to earn a professional title in Web and Mobile Web Development (DWWM). The objective was to create an application aimed at offering a cleaning service to individuals. I worked with Messaoud Houri, Ammar-Khodja Tinhinane and Ricky Richard in this projects. If you want to see the conception documents and the different commits go to https://github.com/KayrozzR/CleanThis.git . However the KayrozzR version do not contain the node and react application.
